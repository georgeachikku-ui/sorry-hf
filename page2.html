            I’m really sorry for ignoring you yesterday. 
            I know I hurt you, and you didn’t deserve that, no matter what happened. 
            I was upset, but I should’ve talked to you instead of going silent. 
            I care about you a lot if you'd trust me, and I hate that I made you feel otherwise. I’m sorry.
